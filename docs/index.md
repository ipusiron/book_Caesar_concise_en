## 👤 About the Author

**IPUSIRON** is a prolific Japanese technical author and educator specializing in security and cryptography.

Born in 1979 in Soma City, Fukushima, Japan, he continues to reside in his hometown.  
With over 20 years of experience in technical writing, he has published **more than 30 books** on cryptography, hacking, and cybersecurity—both commercially and independently.

Notable titles include:

- _The Complete Guide to Cryptography (暗号技術のすべて)_
- _How to Build a Hacking Lab - Complete Edition (ハッキング・ラボのつくりかた 完全版)_
- _The Textbook of White-Hat Hackers (ホワイトハッカーの教科書)_
- _The Hacker’s School: A Handbook of Lockpicking (ハッカーの学校 鍵開けの教科書)_

He is also an experienced translator and editorial supervisor of cryptographic literature.

Notable translation projects include:

- One of the supervising translators of _Serious Cryptography_ by Jean-Philippe Aumasson (Japanese edition)  
- The translator of _Codebreaking: A Practical Guide_ by Elonka Dunin and Klaus Schmeh (Japanese edition)  
- The translator of _Cracking Codes with Python_ by Al Sweigart (Japanese edition)

His professional background includes:

- Developing business applications
- Inspecting and debugging mobile and web apps
- Installing physical security and disaster prevention systems

He currently focuses on writing, lecturing, and tool development, while continuing comprehensive research across information, physical, and human security domains.

His educational philosophy emphasizes active learning—encouraging readers not just to read, but to “learn by doing.”

In recent years, he has expanded into independently published technical books, commonly known as “doujinshi” in Japan. These self-published works allow him to explore niche topics and reach a broader range of readers beyond commercial publishing.

He has also presented at security conferences, high schools, and technical book fairs such as 技術書典 (Gijutsu-Shoten).

He serves as a board member of the **Cyber Risk Defender Association**, a Japanese non-profit organization focused on security awareness and education.

He is also the founder of **Security Akademeia**, a long-running blog where he shares tutorials, cryptographic tools, and insights from the Japanese security community.

This book is the first English installment in his **Classical Cipher Series**, aimed at introducing foundational cryptographic methods to an international audience.
