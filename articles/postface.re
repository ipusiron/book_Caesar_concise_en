= Afterword

Thank you for reading @<i>{Caesar Cipher Breaking - A Concise Edition}.

In recent years, classical ciphers have often taken a backseat in cryptography books—especially in Japan, where this trend is particularly noticeable. For commercial publications, prioritizing sales is inevitable, so this outcome is understandable.

In contrast, this book is a self-published work, which means I could freely focus on the content I truly wanted to share without worrying about profitability. For a long time, I had wanted to write a book that focuses on a single classical cipher, rather than covering all of them broadly. From the beginning, I knew the first topic would be the Caesar cipher. As such, this book marks the first volume in the Classical Cipher Series, with Caesar as its starting point.

The Caesar cipher is simple in structure, yet it embodies the essence of substitution ciphers.
Once you understand this essence, you will no longer be intimidated by more complex substitution ciphers.

This book aims not only to explain the cipher itself but also to convey the charm of classical cryptography.
I hope that this small volume will help many readers discover the fascination of classical ciphers and contribute to renewed interest in this field.

Finally, I have a small request. I would be grateful for any honest feedback or impressions you may have about this book. Whether through posts on X or reviews on Amazon—any form is welcome. Your candid opinions will be incredibly helpful for my future writing.

Thank you again for your support, and I hope you continue to enjoy the world of cryptography.
