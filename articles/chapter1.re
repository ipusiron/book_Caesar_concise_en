= About This Book

This book focuses on the Caesar cipher, one of the most famous and simplest classical ciphers, along with its natural extension—the shift cipher.

While conventional cryptography books typically devote only a few pages to these ciphers, this book dedicates an entire volume to exploring them in depth. You will fully understand both the Caesar cipher and the shift cipher, gaining insight into the essence of classical cryptography.

The shift cipher's simplicity makes it easy to apply, and it forms the foundation for several advanced classical and modern ciphers. By mastering these fundamental concepts, you'll develop a fresh perspective on modern cryptographic systems.

== The Original Book Has Full and Simplified Versions

This book is an English translation of "How to Decipher Caesar Ciphers: Simplified Version," originally published in Japanese.

The Japanese edition comes in two versions:

 * Full version: 16 chapters + 5 appendices with detailed explanations
 ** @<href>{https://hack.booth.pm/items/5557030}
 * Simplified version: 5 chapters + 1 appendix focusing on essentials
 ** @<href>{https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FH1DT5RX}

This English edition, based on the simplified version, is ideal for readers who want to quickly grasp Caesar cipher mechanisms and decryption methods.

Depending on reader response and interest, we may consider translating the full version or creating an expanded edition in the future.

== Why Start Studying Classical Ciphers Now?

=== Many Unsolved Ciphertexts Still Remain

There are still many unsolved ciphertexts left in the world. Some are world-famous, while others were created by ordinary individuals and may seem insignificant from a historical standpoint.

It is commonly believed that the number of unsolved ciphertexts will not increase, but this is not actually the case. During the dismantling or organization of libraries or old houses, previously unknown documents, journals, and notes are sometimes discovered. Among these documents, there are occasionally ciphertexts.

If you're interested, try accessing the ciphertext database on HCPortal (Portal of Historical Ciphers). It contains a wide range of ciphertexts, including encrypted postcards and notes. Each entry is tagged as either "Solved" or "Not solved", making it easy to find unsolved ciphertexts.

If you succeed in deciphering a famous unsolved ciphertext, it will undoubtedly bring you great recognition—possibly even beyond the cryptography and IT communities.

=== Classical Ciphers Satisfy Intellectual Curiosity

The final reason to study classical ciphers is that they satisfy intellectual curiosity.

Knowing about classical ciphers as trivia might come in handy two or three times in your life. Since they frequently appear in movies and novels, understanding them will enhance your enjoyment of these stories.

Classical ciphers can be created with nothing more than pen and paper, making them useful for secret communication when computers are unavailable. There have been documented cases of prisoners under surveillance using classical ciphers to communicate with each other or with people on the outside.
